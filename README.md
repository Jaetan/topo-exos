This repository contains solutions to a selection of exercises on the subject of logic, set theory, and topology.

# Background

I have started a small group with friends and colleagues interested in mathematics, whose intent is to learn more about topology. As the group members have different backgrounds and experience with the subject, we decided to pick a book that would build the subject from the basics without imposing too much formalism from the start. We chose James Munkres' "Topology", 2nd edition.

As I have more experience on the subject than other group members, my role switched to that of a coach for the group. As well as answering questions regarding the main text, I select some exercises from each section, as we progress through the book, and write solutions to them. We do not have enough free time to work on every exercise from the sections we have studied already, though.

# Contents

The repository contains the LaTeX sources for the solutions, named after the section the exercises appear in, as well as the PDF produced from these sources. The LaTeX version used to compile the sources comes from the texlive and AMS packages available in the stable Debian distribution. For compilation, the latex-mf package available in the same distribution is used.

# Intent

This repository is meant to provide a common place to keep the progress of the group, and serve as a backup of the LaTeX sources on my hard drive. It might be of interest to others outside our small group, but as it tracks our progress, new content will only be added after we reached the corresponding section of the book.
