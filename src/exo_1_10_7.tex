\begin{exercise}

  Let $J$ be a well-ordered set. A subset $J_0$ of $J$ is said to be \emph{inductive} if for every $\alpha \in J$,
  \begin{equation*}
    ( S_\alpha \subset J_0 ) \implies \alpha \in J_0
  \end{equation*}

  \begin{theorem}
    (The principle of transfinite induction). If $J$ is a well-ordered set and $J_0$ is an inductive subset of $J$, then $J_0 = J$.
  \end{theorem}

\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}

  Let $x \in J$. If $x$ has an immediate predecessor $y$, then $S_x = S_y \cup \{ y \}$.
  Otherwise, let $A_x = \cup_{y < x} S_y$. If $x_0 \in S_x$, then there exists $y \in S_x$ such that $x_0 < y$,
  since $x$ does not have an immediate predecessor. From this we deduce that $x_0 \in A_x$. Conversely, if $x_0 \in A_x$,
  then there exists $y < x$ such that $x_0 \in S_y \subset S_x$. Therefore $A_x = S_x$.

  If $J = \varnothing$, then the only subset of $J$ is $J_0 = J = \varnothing$, which is inductive. Suppose then that $J \neq \varnothing$,
  and that there exists $x \in J - J_0$. Since J is well-ordered, there exists a smallest such element $\alpha$.

  If $\alpha$ has an immediate predecessor $\beta$, then $S_\alpha = S_\beta \cup \{ \beta \}$. For all $x < \alpha$, we have
  $x \in J_0$, so that $S_\beta \subset J_0$ and $\beta \in J_0$. Since $J_0$ is inductive, we deduce that $\alpha \in J_0$,
  which is a contradiction.

  Suppose then that $\alpha$ does not have an immediate predecessor, then $S_\alpha = \cup_{x < \alpha} S_x$. For all $x < \alpha$, we have
  $x \in J_0$ so that $\cup_{x < \alpha} S_x \subset J_0$, and, from the inductivity of $J_0$, $\alpha \in J_0$, which is again
  a contradiction.

  Therefore such an $\alpha$ does not exist. From this we conclude that $J_0 = J$.
