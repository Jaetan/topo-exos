\begin{exercise}

  A collection $\mathscr{A}$ of subsets of a set $X$ is said to be of \emph{finite type}
  provided that a subset $B$ of $X$ belongs to $\mathscr{A}$ if and only if every finite
  subset of $B$ belongs to $\mathscr{A}$.
  Show that the Kuratowski lemma implies the following:

\begin{lemma}[Tukey, 1940]
  Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a collection of sets. If $\mathscr{A}$ is of finite type, then
  $\mathscr{A}$ has an element that is properly contained in no other element of $\mathscr{A}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

  Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a collection of sets such that $\mathscr{A}$ is of finite type,
  and let $\mathscr{B}$ be a subcollection of $\mathscr{A}$ that is simply ordered by proper inclusion.
  For all $B \in \mathscr{B}$, $B \in \mathscr{A}$, and $\mathscr{A}$ is of finite type,
  so every finite subset of $B$ is an element of $\mathscr{A}$.

  Let $U = \cup_{b \in \mathscr{B}} \,b$, and let $C$ be a finite subset of $U$.
  If $C$ is empty, then $C$ is a subset of $\mathscr{A}$. Otherwise, $C = \{ c_1, \dotsc, c_n \}$,
  and for all $i \in \{ 1, \dotsc, n \}$, there exists $B_i \in \mathscr{B}$ such that $c_i \in B_i$.
  As a subset of the simply ordered set $\mathscr{B}$, the set $\{ B_1, \dotsc, B_n \}$ is simply ordered.
  Since it is also finite, it has a largest element $B_m$. For all $i \in \{ 1, \dotsc, n \}$,
  we have $B_i \subset B_m$. From this we deduce that $C$ is a finite subset of $B_m$,
  and hence an element of $\mathscr{A}$.

  Every finite subset of the set $U$ is an element of $\mathscr{A}$, and $\mathscr{A}$ is of finite type,
  so $U \in \mathscr{A}$. We can therefore apply Kuratowski's lemma and conclude that there exists
  and element of $\mathscr{A}$ that is properly contained in no other element of $\mathscr{A}$.
