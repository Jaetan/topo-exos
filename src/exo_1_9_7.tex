\begin{exercise}

  Let $A$ and $B$ be two nonempty sets. If there is an injection of $B$ into $A$,
  but no injection of $A$ into $B$, we say that $A$ has \emph{greater cardinality} than $B$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]

  \item Conclude from Theorem 9.1 that every uncountable set has greater cardinality than $\mathbb{Z}_+$.
  \item Show that if $A$ has greater cardinality than $B$, and $B$ has greater cardinality than $C$,
    the $A$ has greater cardinality than $C$.
  \item Find a sequence $A_1, A_2, \dotsc$ of infinite sets such that for each $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$,
    the set $A_{n + 1}$ has greater cardinality than $A_n$.
  \item Find a set that for every $n$ has a greater cardinality than $A_n$.

  \end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}\hfill

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]

  \item Let $A$ be an uncountable set. Since every finite set is countable, $A$ must be infinite.
    From theorem 9.1, we deduce that there exists an injection $f : \mathbb{Z}_+ \to A$.
    Since $A$ is uncountable, there is no injection from $A$ into $\mathbb{Z}_+$,
    and therefore $A$ has greater cardinality than $\mathbb{Z}_+$.

  \item Suppose that $A$ has greater cardinality than $B$ and $B$ has greater cardinality than $C$,
    and let $f : B \to A$ and $g : C \to B$ be injections. Then $f \circ g$ is an injection of $C$ into $A$.
    Suppose that there exists an injection $h : A \to C$, and let $h' = h | f ( B )$ and $f' : B \to f ( B )$, $x \mapsto f (x)$.
    $f'$ is a bijection, so $h' \circ f' : B \to C$ is an injection. This is a contradiction with $B$ having greater cardinality than $C$,
    so such an $h$ does not exist, and therefore $A$ has greater cardinality than $C$.

  \item Define a sequence of sets by
    \begin{align*}
      A_1 &= \mathbb{Z}_+ \\
      A_{n + 1} &= \mathscr{P} ( A_n ) &\text{ for all } n \in \mathbb{Z}_+
    \end{align*}
    For all $n$, we have $A_n \in A_{n + 1}$, so that $f_n : A_n \to A_{n + 1}$, $x \mapsto \{ x \}$ is an injection of $A_n$ into $A_{n + 1}$.
    However, there is no injection of $\mathscr{P} ( A_n )$ into $A_n$, so $A_{n + 1}$ has greater cardinality than $A_n$.

    \item Let
    \begin{equation*}
      A = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+} A_n
    \end{equation*}
    For all $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$, $A_n \subset A$, so the function $i_n : A_n \to A$, $x \mapsto x$ is an injection.
    Suppose that there is an injection $h : A \to A_m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}_+$. Then $h \circ i_{m + 1}$ is an injection
    of $A_{m + 1}$ into $A_m$, which contradicts the fact that $A_{m + 1}$ has greater cardinality than $A_m$.
    Therefore $A$ has greater cardinality than every $A_n$.

  \end{enumerate}

\end{proof}
