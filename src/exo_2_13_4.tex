  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]

  \item If $\{ \mathscr{T}_\alpha \}$ is a family of topologies on $X$, show that $\cap \mathscr{T}_\alpha$
    is a topology on $X$. Is $\cup \mathscr{T}_\alpha$ a topology on $X$?

  \item Let $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$ be a family of topologies on $X$. Show that there is a unique smallest topology on $X$
    containing all the collections $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$, and a unique largest topology contained in all $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$.

  \item If $X = \{ a, b, c \}$, let
    \begin{align*}
      \mathscr{T}_1 = \big\{ \varnothing, X, \{ a \}, \{ a, b \} \big\} &&\text{ and }&& \mathscr{T}_2 = \{ \varnothing, X, \{ a \}, \{ b, c \} \}
    \end{align*}
    Find the smallest topology containing $\mathscr{T}_1$ and $\mathscr{T}_2$, and the largest topology contained in $\mathscr{T}_1$ and $\mathscr{T}_2$.

  \end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}

\begin{proof} \hspace{0pt} \\

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]

  \item Since $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$ is a topology for all $\alpha$, it contains both $X$ and $\varnothing$.
    These two sets are thus elements of $\cap \mathscr{T}_\alpha$.

    Let $( U_\beta )_{\beta \in J}$ be a family of elements of $\cap \mathscr{T}_\alpha$.
    For all $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$ and all $\beta \in J$, $U_\beta \in \mathscr{T}_\alpha$,
    which is a topology; therefore $\cup_{\beta \in J} \,U_\beta \in \mathscr{T}_\alpha$.
    This implies that $\cup_{\beta \in J} \,U_\beta \in \cap \mathscr{T}_\alpha$.

    Similarly, for all $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$ and all finite collection $\{ U_1, \dotsc, U_n \}$
    of elements of $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$, $U_1 \cap \dotsb \cap U_n$ is an element of $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$,
    and therefore an element of $\cap \mathscr{T}_\alpha$.

    From the above we conclude that $\cap \mathscr{T}_\alpha$ is a topology.

    Let $X = \{ a, b \}$, $T_1 = \big\{ \varnothing, X, \{ a \} \big\}$ and
    $T_2 = \{ \varnothing, X, \{ b \} \}$. Then $\{ a \}$ and $\{ b \}$ are
    elements of $T_1 \cup T_2$, but $\{ a, b \}$ is not. Therefore $\cup \mathscr{T}_\alpha$
    is not in general a topology.

  \item Let $T = \cap \mathscr{T}_\alpha$; it is a topology contained in all $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$.
    Let $T'$ be a topology contained in all $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$, and let $U \in T'$. For all $\alpha$,
    $U \in \mathscr{T}_\alpha$, so that $T' \subset T$, and $T$ is then the largest topology contained
    in all $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$.

    Let $S = \cup \mathscr{T}_\alpha$, we have $\cup_{v \in S} \,v = X$, since $X$ is an element of
    $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$. Let $T$ be the topology generated by the subbasis $S$;
    $T$ contains all elements of $S$, and therefore contains $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$.
    Conversely, let $T'$ be a topology containing $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$. Then $T'$
    contains $S$, and therefore all unions of finite intersections of elements of $S$; from this
    we deduce that $T'$ contains $T$, and $T$ is the smallest topology containing all $\mathscr{T}_\alpha$.

  \item Applying the above, and noting $\tau ( A )$ for the topology generated by a subbasis $A$,
    we find that the largest topology containing $\mathscr{T}_1$ and $\mathscr{T}_2$ is
    \begin{equation*}
      \mathscr{T}_1 \cap \mathscr{T}_2 = \big\{ \varnothing, X, \{ a \} \big\}
    \end{equation*}
    For $\tau ( \mathscr{T}_1 \cup \mathscr{T}_2 )$, the finite intersections of elements of $\mathscr{T}_1$
    and $\mathscr{T}_2$ are
    \begin{equation*}
      \varnothing, X, \{ a \}, \{ a, b \}, \{ b \}, \{ b, c \}
    \end{equation*}
    and their unions are
    \begin{equation*}
      \tau ( \mathscr{T}_1 \cup \mathscr{T}_2 ) = \big\{ \varnothing, X, \{ a \}, \{ a, b \}, \{ b \}, \{ b, c \} \big\}
    \end{equation*}

\end{enumerate}

\end{proof}
