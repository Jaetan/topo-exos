\begin{exercise}

Show that the topologies of $\mathbb{R}_\ell$ and $\mathbb{R}_K$ are not comparable.

\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}

  Let $x = 0$ and $B = ( {-1}, 1 ) - K$; suppose that there exists $B' = [ a, b )$ containing $x$ such that $B' \subset B$.
  If there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $b > 1 / n$, then $1 / ( n + 1 )$ is in $B'$ but not in $B$, which
  contradicts $B' \subset B$. Therefore $b < 1 / n$ for all $n$; but this implies that $b \leq 0$, so that $0 \notin B'$,
  contrary to our hypothesis. Thus the topology of $\mathbb{R}_\ell$ is not finer than that of $\mathbb{R}_K$.

  Consider now $B' = [ 0, 1 )$ and suppose that there exists $B \in \mathbb{R}_K$ containing $x$ and included in $B'$.
  The set $B$ has a greatest lower bound $a$. Since $0 \in B$ we have $a \leq 0$, and since $B \subset B'$ we have $a \geq 0$.
  Therefore $B = ( 0, b )$ or $( 0, b ) - K$ for some real $b \geq 0$; but this implies that $0 \notin B$, contrary to
  hypothesis. Therefore the topology of $\mathbb{R}_K$ is not finer than that of $\mathbb{R}_\ell$.

  From the above we conclude that these two topologies are not comparable.

\end{proof}
